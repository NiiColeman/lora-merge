    Summary of S-DoRA CIFAR-100 Benchmark

    1. Benchmark Setup:
    - Split CIFAR100 into 10 tasks using Avalanche
    - Each task has 10 classes with class-incremental setup

    2. SLoRA Class Structure:
    - Manages LoRA directions, alphas, and Incremental classifier + mask
    - ParameterList for alphas allows independent learning per task

    3. Training Strategy:
    - Task 0: Train LoRA direction (AB matrices) and alpha
    - Tasks 1-9: Freeze LoRA direction, only train new alpha and classifier
    - Uses masks to focus on current task classes

    4. Evaluation:
    - Tests each trained task on all previous tasks
    - Tracks accuracy using incrementally trained classifier with mask
    - Maintains running evaluation metrics

    5. Logging:
    - Timestamped files for experiment tracking
    - Records loss, accuracy, and key events
    - Uses tqdm for progress visualization
